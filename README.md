# About the Project
A PDF converter app using NodeJS and Cloudmersive API built to convert various file formats into PDF files. NodeJS is a powerful server-side JavaScript runtime environment, while Cloudmersive API is a cloud-based API platform that provides various services, including file conversion.

The app is designed to accept files from the user, which are then uploaded to the NodeJS server. The server can then make use of the Cloudmersive API to convert the file into PDF format. The converted file can then be downloaded or sent back to the user via email.

Using NodeJS allows for the app to handle multiple requests at once and provides an efficient way to handle file uploads and downloads. Cloudmersive API provides a reliable and scalable solution for file conversion, which can handle a wide variety of file formats. Together, these technologies can be used to build a robust PDF converter app.
